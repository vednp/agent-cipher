The reason why is a hashing algorithm does not inherently produce a unique string for the same password text each time itâ€™s received. In other words, suppose your password looks like the example above (Password@1234). Each time the algorithm receives the same input string, it will always produce the same hash string (i.e. 0F1BA603C1A843A3D02D6C5038D8E959). This is not ideal because a hacker can launch a rainbow attack on your database to crack the passwords stored inside.").font(.system(size: 20, weight: .ultraLight, design: .serif)).padding(.init(top: 0, leading: 20, bottom: 40, trailing: 20)).lineSpacing(10)

                        Text("Our problem with hashing is fixed with a simple solution: using salt. Salt is a randomly generated, fixed-length value that is designed to be unique with each user password. Salt is appended with the current password string and fed into the hashing system to produce a newly hashed result every time a user creates a password. This means that if you and I have the same password, our hashed strings would be different. And since rainbow table attacks heavily depend on finding a match, it would render them useless.").lineSpacing(10)
